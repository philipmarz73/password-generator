# Password Generator

This Application is designed to randomly generate a secure password of between 8 and 128 characters in length. The application's potential utility is self-evident in this age of unprecedented exposure of sensitive information on the internet. This application incorporates numbers, upper- and lowercase letters and 20 special characters like ampersands(&), hashmarks(#), etc.; the User can use any or all of these in combination to create a secure password. A no-frills screen drops down a series of prompts that invites the User to select which criteria to use, and choose a password length of between 8 and 128 characters. Each prompt responds to the User's input by validating the User's choice, and when all prompts have been answered then the User can click a button and a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. This is then displayed on the page to the User.


## Resources

This project was designed to help teach common JavaScript functions; the HTML and styling were provided for us, and functionality demonstrated by a GIF. In order to achieve functionality, at the click of a button we had to be able to account for and use different combinations of type of input allowed to the User, take in the length desired by the User, and return to the page a randomly-generated combination of characters of the chosen inputs of the requested length.


## Functionality

The application was fully functional, as required. A Video link demonstrating this functionality is included here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SaiZC088zXDwNh_6_K03reIaa5GL-t7_/view
