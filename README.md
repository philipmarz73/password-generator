# Password Generator

This Application is designed to randomly generate a secure password of between 8 and 128 characters in length. The application's utility is self-evident in this age of unprecedented exposure of sensitive information on the internet. This application incorporates numbers, upper- and lowercase letters and 20 special characters like ampersands(&), hashmarks(#), etc. The User can use any or all of these in combination to create a secure password. A no-frills screen drops down a series of prompts that invites the User to selectwhich criteria to use, and choose a password length of between 8 and 128 characters. Each prompt responds to the User's input by validating the User's choice, and when all prompts have been answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. This is then displayed on the page for the User.
